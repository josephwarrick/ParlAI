### Initial thoughts:
I've never used bitbucket pipelines before, but I expect it should be relatively similar to other CI/CD systems I've used.
I'm not familiar with ParlAI at all.
From speaking with Joseph Hamala I recall that most of Helm's code is in Typescript, so I'm mildly surprised to see a python project, although I suppose the laguange doesn't matter a huge amount for the CI/CD pipeline.
I have some experience with Python, but mostly smaller projects, nothing as large as ParlAI appears to be.
I see that there is a `.circleci/config.yml`; this should give me some idea of what the project is expected to do, and a model to base the bitbucket CI pipeline off of.
